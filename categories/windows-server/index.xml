      <description>Connecting to a Linux console in XenServer is is easy as xl console, but slightly more difficult with a Windows VM since the terminal can&amp;rsquo;t display the Windows GUI. SSH tunneling and VNC to the rescue. First, grab the VNC port the Windows VM uses with the following command. You&amp;rsquo;ll need the dom-id of the Windows VM. xl listor xe vm-list name-label=YourWindowsNameLabel params=dom-idto find it.
So the Windows VM has the console running on 127.</description>

      <description>I experienced a weird time sync issue today with my Windows VMs. I went to stream something to my PS3 from a network share, but I received an error. I thought the share had just lost connection and I needed to reconnect it. When I tried that I received a couple errors, extended error or something and an error stating the time in Windows was different than the server I was trying to connect to.</description>
