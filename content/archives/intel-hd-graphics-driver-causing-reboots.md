<p>I haven&#8217;t purchaed a dedicated graphics card yet for my new build so I&#8217;m using the Core i5&#8217;s built-in GPU. This updated GPU is a major improvement over past integrated GPU attempts. After installing the latest Intel HD graphics driver I found my system in a reboot loop every time it went to load Windows. Weird since this was a new Windows install with Intel drivers that had been out since December. After some Googling I found Windows 7 needs to be updated to Service Pack 1 for these graphics drivers to work properly. I guess I <em>should</em> have done that first anyways, but oh well. So if your having issues with the Intel HD graphics driver rebooting your system after installing, update Windows 7 to Service Pack 1 first.</p>
