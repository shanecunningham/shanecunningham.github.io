<p>I keep forgetting how good of a resource <a href="http://library.linode.com/" target="_blank">Linode Library</a> is for Linux beginners. It covers pretty much all the basic system administration you will need for not only Linode servers, but pretty much any LAMP or LEMP stack. They have great explanations along with the commands to use.</p>
