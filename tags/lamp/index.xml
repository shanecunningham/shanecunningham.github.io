      <description>These tools will help in never having to manually add virtual hosts to your Apache server. Well, maybe not ever, but they will be able to create your virtual hosts in most cases.
This is basically the same tool but executed a little differently. There is an excellent post on community.rackspace.comthat covers usage. First run this to include all .conf files and create the vhost.d directory in CentOS/RHEL.

      <description>I use these two tools pretty often and thought I would mention them here. They analyze your Apache and MySQL configurations and make general recommendations. That doesn&amp;rsquo;t mean you need to follow these, but they are good at showing you overviews of your configs that you can use in addition to other data to make configuration change decisions.
Apachebuddy.plThis is a one liner you can use to run apachebuddy.pl, it will analyze your currently running Apache processes and configurations, how much memory they are using and how much memory you have on the server to make recommendations.</description>
