A few months ago I switched my blog over to Tumblr. I liked Tumblr for the most part, but the lack of control finally got to me. So, I am back to using Wordpress. I'm also using a VPS instead of shared hosting I used on my first Wordpress blog.

To import my Tumblr blog into Wordpress I used <a title="Tumblr Importer 0.5" href="http://wordpress.org/extend/plugins/tumblr-importer/">Tumblr Import 0.5</a>. When I tried using it I keptÂ receiving an error stating there was a connection problem with Tumblr. From what I found with a few Google searches this is a very generic error. I finally found something worth trying - turn my custom .com domain that I used with Tumblr, off. That fixed the problem and Tumblr Importer successfully imported my Tumblr blog into Wordpress.
