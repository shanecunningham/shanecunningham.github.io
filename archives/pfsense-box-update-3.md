I had a feeling using a <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820239005">cheap $7 flash drive</a> as the boot OS might be a bad idea. Turns out it was. The drive started throwing errors after about a month and a half of running pfSense for my network. I didn't want to go mechanical HDD for a 24x7 low power box so I decided on a <a href="http://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=N82E16820227510">OCZ Onyx 32 GB SSD</a>. More than enough size and speed for how I am using it. Hopefully this is the last hiccup with this machine and I can now get into some more advanced features of <a href="http://www.pfsense.org/">pfSense</a>.
