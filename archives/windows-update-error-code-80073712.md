<p>My main desktop PC was dormant for some time and I recently just got it back up. When I tried to install all the Windows Updates that had accumulated I started to receive error Code 80073712. After trying to install them multiple times I Googled the error code but found the solutions did not help. <a href="http://www.windowsreference.com/windows-vista/fix-for-vista-sp1-install-error-80073712-through-windows-update/" target="_blank">This</a> fix didn&#8217;t help since I didn&#8217;t have the pending.xml file on my system. </p>
<p>After some more searching I found a free tool from Microsoft that fixed my problems. <a href="http://support.microsoft.com/kb/971058" target="_blank">Microsoft Fix it 50202</a> will reset your Windows Update components. I ran the default fix but you can also run an Aggressive mode too. I had to search for new updates a couple times after running it but eventually I was able to install all the Windows Updates. </p>
