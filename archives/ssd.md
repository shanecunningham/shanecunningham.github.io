I finally took the plunge and bought my first SSD. Newegg had a sale on the Crucial RealSSD C300 128GB and I decided to get it. After installing Windows 7 with Service Pack 1 and a few drivers, I still have 91GB left. Not too bad and now all I need to do is figure out how to carve out some space to dual boot Linux. Below is my first benchmark, no tweaking but from what I have read with Windows 7 and TRIM enabled, you don’t need any.
